# matmul
MATMUL is a C program which compares various methods for computing the matrix product           A * B = C.        MATMUL can do this for a variety of matrix sizes, and for different arithmetics (real, complex, double precision, integer, even logical!) There are many algorithms built in, including the simple triple DO loop (actually not so simple; there are 6 ways to set it up), some unrolling techniques, and the level 1 and 2 BLAS routines.  MATMUL is interactive, so the user can easily pursue any line of inquiry that seems promising. New algorithms or locally available methods are not to hard to add.
